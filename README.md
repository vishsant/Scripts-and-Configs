# Vishnu's "Configs"

Hi, there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Vishnu, a tech enthusiast from India, and I love to inspire and educate people.

This Repository **configs** contain my personal config files. Here you'll find configs, customizations, themes, and whatever I need to personalize my Linux and Windows experience.

> :warning: Be aware, products can change over time. I do my best to keep up with the latest changes and releases, but please understand that this wonâ€™t always be the case.
